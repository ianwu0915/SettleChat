# API Endpoints

## WebSocket
- `/ws`: WebSocket connection endpoint for real-time chat

## Authentication
- `/register`: Register a new user
- `/login`: User login
- `/user`: Get user information by ID

## Room Management
- `/rooms/create`: Create a new chat room
- `/rooms/join`: Join an existing chat room
- `/rooms/leave`: Leave a chat room
- `/rooms`: Get list of rooms for the current user

## Static Files
- `/`: Serves static files from the `web` directory

## Implementation
The API endpoints are implemented in [cmd/server/handler/](mdc:cmd/server/handler) with:
- `AuthHandler`: Handles authentication endpoints
- `RoomHandler`: Manages room-related operations
- `WebsocketHandler`: Handles WebSocket connections

## Request Flow
1. HTTP requests are routed through the main server
2. Handlers process the requests and interact with:
   - Storage layer for persistence
   - NATS for message distribution
   - Hub for WebSocket connections

# SettleChat Project Overview

SettleChat is a real-time chat application built in Go with WebSocket support and NATS messaging system.

## Core Components

### Entry Point
The main application entry point is [cmd/server/main.go](mdc:cmd/server/main.go), which initializes all core components and starts the HTTP server.

### Key Directories
- `cmd/server/`: Contains the main application entry point
- `internal/`: Core application logic
  - `ws/`: WebSocket handlers and connection management
  - `chat/`: Chatroom, Client, and Hub implementations
  - `ai/`: AI integration (DeepSeek, OpenAI)
  - `storage/`: Message persistence (SQLite)
  - `command/`: Command processing logic
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
- `web/`: Static assets and frontend build output

### Main Features
1. Real-time chat using WebSocket
2. Message persistence with PostgreSQL
3. NATS messaging for distributed communication
4. User authentication and room management
5. AI integration capabilities

### Architecture
The application uses a hub-based architecture where:
1. The Hub manages WebSocket connections
2. NATS handles message distribution
3. PostgreSQL stores persistent data
4. HTTP endpoints handle REST operations
